What remains for trying is to play more with different methods of preprocessingthe data. We believe that different approaches to deal with the data beforetrying to learn a model can lead to significantly better results.Furthermore, manipulating other parameters of each algorithm to reach the bestspot is another motivation for keeping continue this experiment and of course itwill be one of the first steps to climb in the future.
