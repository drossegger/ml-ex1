\section{Introduction}
What you are about to read, discusses different classification algorithms
applied on three datasets, Contraceptive Method Choice~\cite{ds1:uci}, First
Order Theorem Proving ~\cite{ds2:uci}~\cite{ds2:paper} and Funniest
Youtube Video based on Youtube Comedy slam Data~\cite{ds3:uci} provided by the
UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Nevertheless in the third dataset, only partial data is provided and a
complement to the dataset must be gathered from
youtube directly.

\par The framework used in the previous experiment on regression is adapted to
perform classification tasks. Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, $k$-nearest neighbors,
Decision Tree and Neural Networks are algorithms which are candidates for
performing the experiment. While PyBrain~\cite{pybrain} is used for neural
networks, all the others are provided by SciKit-Learn~\cite{scikit}.

The five mentioned algorithms above are applied to all the datasets with
different types of preprocessing and subsequently tuned using a test dataset.
Afterwards the results are checked using a validation dataset.

\par In the next chapter algorithms which were not introduced in the report of
the previous experiment on regression techniques as well as some special
preprocessing methods are explained.
Immediately after that, the datasets are described all along with the results of
the experiments and their interpretations. Finally at the end a conclusion is drawn.
