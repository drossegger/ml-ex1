\section{Introduction}
For this assignment different classification algorithms were applied on two datasets, Contraceptive Method Choice~\cite{ds1:uci} and First Order Theorem Proving~\cite{ds2:uci}~\cite{ds2:paper} provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Another third dataset, Youtube Comedy slam Data~\cite{ds3:uci} has a description on UCI but the actual data was gathered from youtube directly.

\par The framework also used in the first assignment was adapted to perform classification tasks. scikit-learn~\cite{scikit} for Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, $k$-nearest neighbors and Decision Tree and pybrain~\cite{pybrain} for neural networks where the two libraries providing the classification algorithms.
The five above mentioned algorithms were applied to all the datasets with different preprocessing and tuned using a test dataset. Afterwards the results were checked using a validation dataset.
\par In the next chapter not yet known algorithms as well as special preprocessing methods are explained, after the datasets are described and the results of the experiments interpreted. At the end a conclusion is drawn.
