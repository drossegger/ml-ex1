\section{Introduction}
In this assignment, we applied many different machine learning techniques on three datasets provided by UCI Machine Learning Repositories \footnote{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html}. The datasets and their characteristics are shown in Table \ref{table:datasets}.

In order to run ML algorithms, we create a ML platform using Python libraries. SciKit-Learn \footnote{http://scikit-learn.org/} and PyBrain  \footnote{http://pybrain.org/} are two main libraries used in the platform. SciKit-Learn provides a vast variety of techniques for preprocessing, data imputing and ML algorithms. In order to fill the lack of Neural Network algorithms for supervised learning in SciKit-Learn, we used PyBrain libraries.

Eight different techniques were implemented in the platform as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ridge Regression
  \item Ridge Regression Cross Validation
  \item Bayesian Ridge Regression
  \item Stochastic Gradient Descent
  \item Decision Tree
  \item K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
  \item Support Vector Machine
  \item Neural Network  
\end{itemize}
