\section{Auto MPG dataset}
\subsection{Description}
Auto MPG \footnote{http://scikit-learn.org/} contains 8 attributes of 398 cars  and their corresponding MPG (Miles Per Gallon) value. The dataset has some missing value in forth column (horsepower). Shortage of data as well as existing some missing values makes the dataset distinct and interesting for ML. Furthermore because of short execution time, it provides us the opportunity to apply all developed algorithms as well as imputation techniques.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
In order to standardized data, we used standard scale which first transforms the data to center it by removing the mean value of each feature and then scales it by dividing non-constant features by their standard deviation \cite{scikitstandardization}.
