\section{Algorithms}
In this chapter, we explain the four main algorithms which are applied on all the datasets. As well as main algorithms, two essential additional ones are briefly described.

\subsection{Linear Ridge Regression}
\subsection{Nearest Neighbor}
\subsection{Support Vector Machine}
\subsection{Stochastic Gradient Descent}
\subsection{Additional Algorithms}
\subsubsection{Polynomial Ridge Regression}
By altering Linear Ridge Regression algorithm and adding more attributes based on exponent value, we prepared Polynomial Ridge Regression.
\subsubsection{Neural Networks}
